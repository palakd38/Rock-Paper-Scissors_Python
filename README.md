# Rock-Paper-Scissors_Python
This is an implementation of the popular Rock-Paper-Scissors game in Python. The game consists of two variants, one is the classic version and the second one is an extended version with Spock and Lizard. The game supports a human player and a computer player.

The Game is programmed in such a way that it is extandable and new variants can be added easily without changing the Game logic. It uses a common Interface Ruleset, using Strategy pattern, applicable to all the variants.
